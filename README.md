# Phishing-Domain-Detection

### Problem Statement 
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The main goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.

### Solution Proposed 
We propose building a machine learning model for phishing domain detection. By leveraging historical data on domain characteristics and known phishing indicators, we will develop a predictive model using techniques such as feature engineering and ensemble learning. The model will be trained on a labelled dataset of domains and their classifications as legitimate or malicious. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable tool for identifying potentially harmful domains in real-time, thus enhancing online security for users.
